# git commands
# what is git?
    # Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project.
    # It keeps track of the changes made to the code and allows you to collaborate with other developers.
    # It is a command line tool that you can use to manage your code.

# process of working with git:
    # code -> git add -> staging area -> git commit -> local repository -> git push -> remote repository

# define the git configuration:
    # version control system = log of changes
    # master branch = main branch
    # branch = a copy of the code
    # merge = combining two branches
    # conflict = when two branches have changes in the same line
    # conflict resolution = resolving the conflict by choosing one of the changes
    # clone = copy of the repository on your local machine = download (just once)
    # fork = copy of the repository on github = upload
    # commit = save the changes
    # pull = get the latest changes from the remote repository
    # push = send the changes to the remote repository
    # pull request = request to merge the changes

# **git just remembers the changes, not the entire file
# **git is a log of changes and it is 2 stage process:
    # **first you add the changes to the staging area
    # **then you commit the changes to the local repository

# github:
    # github is a website that hosts git repositories
    # it allows you to collaborate with other developers
    # it provides a graphical interface to work with git
    # you can do the same things on your local machine using the git command line

# user interface:
    # GUI = graphical user interface
    # CLI = command line interface
        #windows = cmd/powershell
        #mac = terminal
        #linux = terminal
        #git = git bash

# linux commands:
    # ls = list files
    # cd = change directory 
    #cd .. = go back one directory level
    #pwd = present working directory
    #mkdir = make directory
    #touch = create a file
    #rm = remove
    #rm -rf = remove directory
    #ls-la = list all files including hidden files
    #cp = copy
    #clear = clear the terminal screen
    #nano = text editor
        #ctrl + x = exit
        #y = yes
    #cat = concatenate and display the content of the file

# git commands:
    # git init = initialize a git repository
    # git status = check the status of the repository
    # git add = add changes to the staging area
        # git add . or * = add all changes
        # git add filename = add specific file
    # git commit = commit changes to the local repository
    # git log = view the commit history 
    # git -m = add a message to the commit
    # git remote = view the remote repository
    #git reset <file_name> = unstage the changes
    #git checkout -- <file name> = revert the changes to the last commit

# branching:
    #git branch = view the branches in the repository
    #git branch branchname = create a new branch
    #git checkout branchname = switch to the branch
