# Branching in Git
# what is branching?
# Branching is a feature in git that allows you to create a copy of the code and work on it separately.
# It is useful when you want to work on a new feature or fix a bug without affecting the main code.
# Each branch has its own copy of the code and changes made to one branch do not affect other branches.
# You can create, switch, merge, and delete branches in git.
# Branching allows you to work on multiple features simultaneously and merge them later.

# process of branching:
# code ->
# git branch -> new branch -> git checkout -> switch to new branch ->
# code -> git commit -> save changes to new branch ->
# git checkout -> switch to main branch -> git merge ->
# merge changes from new branch to main branch

# types of branches:
# master branch = main branch
# feature branch = branch for new features
# bugfix branch = branch for fixing bugs
# release branch = branch for releasing the code
# hotfix branch = branch for fixing critical bugs

# git commands for branching:
# git branch = list all branches
# git branch <branch_name> = create a new branch
# git checkout <branch_name> = switch to a branch
# git checkout -b <branch_name> = create and switch to a new branch
# git merge <branch_name> = merge changes from a branch
# git branch -d <branch_name> = delete a branch (if changes are merged)
# git branch -D <branch_name> = force delete a branch (if changes are not merged)

# branching strategies:
# feature branching = create a new branch for each feature
# git flow = a branching model for git
# trunk-based development = main branch is always stable
# release branching = create a branch for each release
# environment branching = create a branch for each environment (dev, test, prod)

# ================================================================================================
# Exercise: Branching in Git
# create a new branch called "feature-login" and switch to it

# git branch feature-login
# git checkout feature-login

# git remote
# what is a remote in git?
# A remote in git is a copy of the repository that is stored on a different server.
# It allows you to collaborate with other developers by sharing your code.
# You can push your changes to the remote repository and pull changes from it.
# The default name of the remote repository on github is "origin".

# process of working with remotes:
# code -> git add -> staging area -> git commit -> local repository ->
# git push -> remote repository -> git pull -> local repository

# git commands for remotes:
# git remote = list all remotes
# git remote -v = list all remotes with URLs
# git remote add <name> <url> = add a new remote
# git remote remove <name> = remove a remote
# git remote rename <old_name> <new_name> = rename a remote

# working with remotes:
# clone a repository = download a copy of the repository
# fork a repository = create a copy of the repository on github
# pull request = request to merge changes from a forked repository
# fetch = get changes from the remote repository without merging

# ================================================================================================
# Tips for pull and push:
# git pull = git fetch + git merge
# pull process in git bash:
# git fetch origin
# git merge origin/master
# pull command in git bash:
# git pull -> ctrl + i = insert -> esc -> :wq = write and quit
